# Tableau Dashboard: Sample Superstore Analysis


## Project Overview:

This Tableau dashboard was created using the Sample Superstore dataset. It provides a comprehensive analysis of sales, profit, and order metrics across various categories, regions, and time periods. The dashboard is interactive and allows users to filter data by year and region, while dynamically adjusting based on selected metrics.

## Features
The dashboard contains several key features:

### 1) Two-Plane Layout:

a) Left Plane: Contains the company logo, interaction controls, and filters for year and region.

b) Right Plane: Contains six dynamic visualizations and three Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards based on selected metrics.

### 2) KPIs: The dashboard tracks the following key metrics:

a. Profit Margin = Total Profit / Total Sales
b. Return Rate = Quantity Returned / Quantity Ordered
c. Number of Orders
### 3) Metric Selector:

A parameter allows users to select a metric (Sales, Profit, or # Orders) for analysis.

Visualizations and tooltips dynamically update based on the selected metric. For example, if "Sales" is selected, the visualization updates to display "Sales by Category."
### 4) Filtering:

Users can filter data by year and region.

A toggle button allows users to hide or display filters for better viewing experience.
### 5) Top 5 Products:

Regardless of filter actions or dropdown selections, the dashboard consistently displays the top 5 products based on the selected metric.
### 6) Dynamic Category Filtering:

Clicking on the category chart filters data in the other visualizations and KPI cards.
### 7) Navigation:

Clicking on the company logo redirects users to the published dashboard on Tableau Public.
### 8) Average and Trend Lines:

Average lines and trend lines are displayed where applicable to aid in data interpretation.

## Visualizations

The right plane features six interactive charts, including:

1. Sales by Category
2. Sales by Sub-Category
3. Sales by Region
4. Top 5 Products by Metric
5. Sales  by Customer Segment
6. Yearly Sales Trends


### Interaction Controls
Metric Parameter: Dynamically switches visualizations between sales, profit, and order data.

1. Year and Region Filters: Filter the data by specific years and regions.

2. Hide/Display Filters Button: Toggles the visibility of the filters for an optimized dashboard view.


### Interactivity
1. Category Filter Action: Interacting with the category chart dynamically filters the other charts and KPI cards.

2. Logo Navigation: Clicking the dashboard logo redirects users to the Tableau Public version of the dashboard.
